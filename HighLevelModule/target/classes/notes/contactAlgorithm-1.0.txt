for pair from sap
if new pair then 
	find new manifold
else
	remove point when new distance > old d or traslation > threshold,
	find new manifold
	compare with remaining old points.
	
	
		
for old pair not suggested by sap /***** thinking if just delete this pairs ******/
/*if min distance > D_THRESHOLD
	remove pair					*/
update and remove points
if no point remained
	remove pair
